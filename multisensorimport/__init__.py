"""Code to aggregate and analyze time series muscle data.

This library contains code to import and manipulate time series data collected
from muscles, including surface electromyography (EMG), acoustic myography
(AMG), force, and ultrasound data. This codebase was designed for data
aggregation and analysis associated with the BioRob 2020 publication listed in
this release's README.md, but in practice, this interface may be used for
arbitrary time series data analysis.
