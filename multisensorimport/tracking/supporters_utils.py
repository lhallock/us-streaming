"""Methods to initialize supporter points and use them to infer contour points.

This module contains functions to initialize supporter points (i.e.,
non-contour points that are easy to track) and use them to infer non-tracked
points along the desired contour. These methods are employed when tracking
using the supporter-based Lucas-Kanade tracking (SBLK) algorithm.

The supporters algorithm is based on the following work:
H. Grabner, J. Matas, L. Van Gool, and P. Cattin. "Tracking the Invisible:
    Learning Where the Object Might Be." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on
    Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010.
